# Overall Introduction
This assignment is an individual project from utm csc309, copyright owned by the course instructor. My role as a full-stack engineer was to develop this website, both front-end (HTML, CSS) and back-end (PHP) components, along with database management using PostgreSQL.

# php-website functionalities
The PHP website is implemented by MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, the architecture responsibilities are: the index.php file serves as the controller, files within the view folder represent views, and those within the model folder function as models.

- Controller: The controller is for user interaction, guiding visitors through the website's functionalities. It integrates with view files to present content to users.
- Views: Files in the view folder render the website's visual interface, ensuring a dynamic and engaging user experience.
- Models: The core business logic, such as game mechanics and data processing, resides in model files. These PHP classes encapsulate the application's functionality, facilitating modular design and maintainability.
